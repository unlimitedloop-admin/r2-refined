# R2 Refined
A solution for building Windows game programs using "DxLib"(https://dxlib.xsrv.jp/index.html).

In this project, we will create a transplanted hacking aimed at rebuilding Mega Man (NES version) (Capcom Co., Ltd.).

!caution!<br>
Please do not relocate the pre-built binaries in this software, it interferes with a complete software company, and do not post this information on the web, these should be handled with care...
I will not be held responsible for any incidents that occur.

We will help you to fully port the Mega Man from NES software.
And the basic algorithm design is created almost as if it were a copy, with no slight difference.
It is also possible to fork this repository for further development. In that case, you don't need to contact me. Of course, it's not that I can't contact you, well own mind :)

Lastly, I can't speak English as well as you guys. forgive me please... >_<<br>
Many thanks
